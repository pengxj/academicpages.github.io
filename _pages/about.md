I have joined [Shenzhen Technology Universit (SZTU)](https://sztu.edu.cn/) as an Associate Professor since Nov. 2, 2020.

I was an Associate Professor at [MMLAB](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn), Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAS-SIAT](http://www.siat.cas.cn/)), China and collaborate closely with Prof. [Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao/index.html).

I was a postdoctoral researcher at Idiap, Martigny, Switzerland from 1/7/2016 to 30/9/2017 and worked with Prof. [Francois Fleuret](http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). My research was funded by the Swiss CTI FARGO project which mainly focus on RGB-IR-D face detection, alignment and recognition. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Inria LEAR/THOTH team](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/) from 1/3/2015 to 30/6/2016 where I worked with [Cordelia Schmid](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/schmid/). My research mainly focused on video action detection.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, advised by Prof. PENG Qiang.

My current interests focus on **affective computing**, **unsupervised & weakly-supervised learning**, **face recognition**, and **AI edge computing**.
