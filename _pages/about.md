I am an Associate Professor at [MMLAB](mmlab.siat.ac.cn), Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences ([CAS-SIAT](http://www.siat.cas.cn/)), China and collaborate closely with Prof. [Yu Qiao](http://mmlab.siat.ac.cn/yuqiao/index.html).

I was a postdoctoral researcher at Idiap, Martigny, Switzerland from 1/7/2016 to 30/9/2017 and worked with Prof. [Francois Fleuret](http://www.idiap.ch/~fleuret/). My research was funded by the Swiss CTI FARGO project which mainly focus on RGB-IR-D face detection, alignment and recognition. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Inria LEAR/THOTH team](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/) from 1/3/2015 to 30/6/2016 where I worked with [Cordelia Schmid](http://lear.inrialpes.fr/people/schmid/). My research mainly focused on video action detection.
I obtained my Ph.D. from Southwest Jiaotong University, China, advised by Prof. PENG Qiang.

My current interests focus on

* human action recognition and detection
* face recognition and 3D reconstruction
* facial emotion analysis
* weakly-supervised deep learning
